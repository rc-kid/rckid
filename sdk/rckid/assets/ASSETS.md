# Assets

The SDK supports creating binary assets that can be included in the ROM files. This is done in a very simple way by converting the raw assets into C++ header files that define constexpr arrays with the information. Some extra asset types, such as font and tile definitions require slightly more processing. While the default SDK assets are always part of this repository, the asset generator utility can be used by cartridges to generate their own extra assets.
