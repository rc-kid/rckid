- [1x display](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005004635814413.html?spm=a2g0o.order_list.order_list_main.5.10891802IbL7I1). 2.8" 320x240 IPS 37pin. There are multiple variants, mk 3 will run with the 16bit MCU interface variant. 

> mk II used the 8bit interface, and it's possible mk3 will actually use the 40pin non-solderable variant. 

- [1x battery](https://www.tme.eu/cz/details/accu-lp503759_cl/akumulatory/cellevia-batteries/l503759/), basically any 503759 battery will do as the wires must be soldered to the board npw. 

> TME lists the battery as available only while stock lasts, but the battery size seems to be popular enough to be sourced from elsewhere. Ideally a battery with a connector should be used for mkIII.
