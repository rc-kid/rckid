# Bill of Materials

Most of the electronic BOM is done by ordering assembled boards (currently from JLCPCB), and as such are not listed here. Refer to the hardware folder for the pcb project. The following are extra items that need to be purchased:

- [1x display](320x240 with fpc: https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005004629215040.html?pdp_npi=4%40dis%21CZK%21CZK%208.90%21CZK%208.90%21%21%210.36%210.36%21%402103891017375828457015857e954c%2112000035688288567%21sh%21CZ%213305825785%21X&spm=a2g0o.store_pc_allItems_or_groupList.new_all_items_2007508297226.1005004629215040) - this is the FPC connector version for easier soldering. The device itself uses 16bit parallel mode. 
- [1x battery](https://www.tme.eu/cz/details/accu-lp503759_cl/akumulatory/cellevia-batteries/l503759/), basically any 503759 battery will do, the device uses a cutom battery connector created from precision headers and a small pcb board.
- [1x rumbler](https://cz.mouser.com/ProductDetail/DFRobot/FIT0774?qs=ljCeji4nMDmZzIiC0gR9iA%3D%3D), hand soldered wires to the pcb
- [1x speaker](), hand soldered wires to the pcb
- [3x buttons](https://cz.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Omron-Electronics/B3U-3000P-B?qs=AO7BQMcsEu4JAdtnbsGArA%3D%3D), hand soldered for home button and volume up & down
- [6x screws](https://www.nerezka.cz/sroub-m-2-x-4-din-965tx-a2), M2x10
- [6x screw inserts](https://www.prusa3d.com/product/threaded-inserts-m2-short-100-pcs/) 
- [battery connector, female]()
- [battery connector, male]()

## Cartridges

- [1x flash memory]()
- [1x 10K resistor]()
- [1x 100nF capacitor]()

- [1x display](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005004635814413.html?spm=a2g0o.order_list.order_list_main.5.10891802IbL7I1). 2.8" 320x240 IPS 37pin. There are multiple variants, mk 3 will run with the 16bit MCU interface variant. 

> mk II used the 8bit interface, and it's possible mk3 will actually use the 40pin non-solderable variant. 

- [1x battery](https://www.tme.eu/cz/details/accu-lp503759_cl/akumulatory/cellevia-batteries/l503759/), basically any 503759 battery will do as the wires must be soldered to the board npw. 

> TME lists the battery as available only while stock lasts, but the battery size seems to be popular enough to be sourced from elsewhere. Ideally a battery with a connector should be used for mkIII.
