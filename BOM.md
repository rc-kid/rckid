# Bill of Materials

Most of the electronic BOM is done by ordering assembled boards (currently from JLCPCB), and as such are not listed here. Refer to the hardware folder for the pcb project. The following are extra items that need to be purchased:

- [1x display, 320x240 IPS FPC 40pin, no touch](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005004629215040.html?pdp_npi=4%40dis%21CZK%21CZK%208.90%21CZK%208.90%21%21%210.36%210.36%21%402103891017375828457015857e954c%2112000035688288567%21sh%21CZ%213305825785%21X&spm=a2g0o.store_pc_allItems_or_groupList.new_all_items_2007508297226.1005004629215040) - this is the FPC connector version for easier soldering. The device itself uses 16bit parallel mode.
