# GameBoy Color Emulator

This will one day hopefully become a fully working GBC emulator on the RCKid hardware. 

> The point of this app is to expand on my skills and technical limitations of RCKid, *not* to use it to play GameBoy Color games illegaly. For those interested, there is a lot of homebrew games whose ROMs can be legally downloaded from sites like itch.io.
